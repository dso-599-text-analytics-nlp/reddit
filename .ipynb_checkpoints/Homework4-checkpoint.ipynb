For example, title **\"australian rodent named 1st mammal go extinct due human-caused climate change\"** and **\"australian rodent first mammal become extinct due climate change  scientist say\"**, are almost the same. However, since they do not share completely the same words, word count and TF-IDF do not do well on catching their similarity, where word count give them 0.61 and TF-IDF gives them 0.45. In contrast, since word embeddings take the words meaning into account, it gives us 0.94, which is closer to our expectation."
