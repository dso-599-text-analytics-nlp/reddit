A great reddit project

In this project we are trying to predict whether a topic is going to be popular or not

Description
A traditionally print news company wants to increase the influence and presence on social media. They have hired a consulting firm to help with their strategy, specifically around attracting reddit users to their main website. They hope to attract more reddit users to read their news. They want to predict the popularity of a news article based on its title.

"whole process jupyter" contains all the steps in Jupyter Notebook.
